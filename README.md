# Web Penetration Testing Portfolio

This repository showcases my **web application penetration testing work**, focusing on identifying and documenting vulnerabilities based on **OWASP Top 10 standards**. It demonstrates my approach to security testing, risk assessment, and remediation guidance.

## Project Overview
- Conducted both **automated and manual penetration testing** on web applications.
- Identified critical vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection, XSS, broken access control, and sensitive data exposure**.
- Created **professional PDF reports** with proof-of-concept screenshots, severity ratings, and remediation recommendations.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Web Application Security Testing  
- Penetration Testing (OWASP Top 10)  
- Vulnerability Assessment & Analysis  
- Ethical Hacking  
- Security Reporting & Remediation Guidance  

## Repository Structure
- `reports/` → PDF penetration testing reports  
- `scripts/` → Sample commands or scripts used for testing  
- `screenshots/` → Proof-of-concept images demonstrating vulnerabilities  

## Disclaimer
This repository is for **educational and professional demonstration purposes only**. All testing was performed in a **legal lab environment (OWASP Juice Shop)**. Do not use these methods on unauthorized systems.# web-penetration-testing-portfolio

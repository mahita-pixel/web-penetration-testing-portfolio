Web Application Penetration Testing Portfolio

This repository demonstrates my practical experience in **web application penetration testing**, with a focus on identifying, validating, and documenting security vulnerabilities aligned with the **OWASP Top 10**.

It is designed to showcase how I approach **real-world security assessments**, deliver **clear and actionable findings**, and help organizations reduce risk through effective remediation guidance.


Scope of Work

- Manual and automated penetration testing of web applications
- Identification of common and critical vulnerabilities, including:
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Broken Access Control (IDOR)
  - Authentication & Session Management Flaws
  - Security Misconfigurations
  - Sensitive Data Exposure
- Risk-based vulnerability analysis with severity classification
- Clear proof-of-concept (PoC) evidence and remediation recommendations

All testing activities were conducted in **authorized lab environments** for educational and demonstration purposes.
